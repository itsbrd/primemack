# PrimeHack – A Dolphin Emulator fork for Metroid Prime Trilogy

PrimeHack is a modified version of [Dolphin-Emu](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) solely for playing Metroid Prime Trilogy for Wii with keyboard and mouse on a PC.

This version of PrimeHack, called PrimeMack on GitHub, is a fork designed to allow anyone on Mac to just download the latest version and play, since compliling from the original PrimeHack repo is a nightmare.

Dolphin is an emulator for running GameCube and Wii games on Windows,
Linux, macOS, and recent Android devices. It's licensed under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later (GPLv2+).

Please read the [FAQ](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/faq/) before using Dolphin.

## System Requirements

### Desktop

* OS
    * macOS (10.14 Mojave or higher).
* Processor
    * A CPU with SSE2 support.
    * A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.
* Graphics
    * A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 10.0 / OpenGL 3.0).
    * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.

## Sys Files

* `wiitdb.txt`: Wii title database from [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/)
* `totaldb.dsy`: Database of symbols (for devs only)
* `GC/font_western.bin`: font dumps
* `GC/font_japanese.bin`: font dumps
* `GC/dsp_coef.bin`: DSP dumps
* `GC/dsp_rom.bin`: DSP dumps
* `Wii/clientca.pem`: Wii network certificate
* `Wii/clientcakey.pem`: Wii network certificate key
* `Wii/rootca.pem`: Wii network certificate issuer / CA

The DSP dumps included with Dolphin have been written from scratch and do not
contain any copyrighted material. They should work for most purposes, however
some games implement copy protection by checksumming the dumps. You will need
to dump the DSP files from a console and replace the default dumps if you want
to fix those issues.

Wii network certificates must be extracted from a Wii IOS. A guide for that can be found [here](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Wii_Network_Guide).

## Folder Structure

These folders are installed read-only and should not be changed:

* `GameSettings`: per-game default settings database
* `GC`: DSP and font dumps
* `Shaders`: post-processing shaders
* `Themes`: icon themes for GUI
* `Resources`: icons that are theme-agnostic
* `Wii`: default Wii NAND contents

## Packaging and udev

commands supported: [convert, verify, header]
```

```Usage: convert [options]... [FILE]...

A number of user writeable directories are created for caching purposes or for
allowing the user to edit their contents. On macOS and Linux these folders are
stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Dolphin/` and `~/.dolphin-emu`
respectively, but can be overwritten by setting the environment variable
`DOLPHIN_EMU_USERPATH`. On Windows the user directory is stored in the `My Documents`
folder by default, but there are various way to override this behavior:

```
Usage: verify [options]...

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user=USER  User folder path, required for temporary processing
                        files.Will be automatically created if this option is
                        not set.
  -i FILE, --input=FILE
                        Path to disc image FILE.
  -a ALGORITHM, --algorithm=ALGORITHM
                        Optional. Compute and print the digest using the
                        selected algorithm, then exit. [crc32|md5|sha1]
```

```
Usage: header [options]...

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i FILE, --input=FILE
                        Path to disc image FILE.
  -b, --block_size      Optional. Print the block size of GCZ/WIA/RVZ formats,
then exit.
  -c, --compression     Optional. Print the compression method of GCZ/WIA/RVZ
                        formats, then exit.
  -l, --compression_level
                        Optional. Print the level of compression for WIA/RVZ
                        formats, then exit.
